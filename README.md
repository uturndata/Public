Uturn QuickStart	
Start - Stop - SnapShot	
Utility server that uses tags to autostart, autostop and snapshot volumes. 
Overview

Amazon currently lacks automation around some key functions include:
•	The ability to start in stop instances on a schedule.
•	The ability to automatically snapshot EBS volumes and store them for standard retention times.
This Quickstart uses a Cloud Formation template to create a single t2.micro instance that requires minimal management it in turn uses tags to target EC2 instances and EBS volumes to control: starting, stopping and snapshotting. The Cloud Formation template also creates a Cloudwatch alarm and an email SNS topic as well an IAM Role that allows the Instance to access the AWS API endpoint. The instance will need access to the public API endpoint to operate.
Design

An instance is deployed with a Role that allows it to act upon instances in volumes within the region.  While the two scripts operate in a similar manner they have been written buy different developers and are implemented separately.

MakeSnapshot		True			only True is needed


Start and Stop
The EC2 instance looks for the auto:start and auto:stop tags to determine when to start and stop instances. The name of the tags are case-sensitive. The value of the tags should be in a cron format. For instance, 0 14 * * * is 2 pm everyday. The time is based on the OS time of the EC2 operator instance. If you have not changed the default time zone of the EC2 operator instance, it should be in UTC. It will ignore any instances that do not have the tags set or the format is invalid. The auto:start tag holds the start schedule, and the auto:stop tag holds the stop schedule. Do not tag the EC2 operator instance, otherwise it will get stopped by itself.

SnapShot EBS
Simply add a tag “MakeSnapshot” and set value to “True” to each volume you want to snapshot, It will handle rolling snapshots on a day, week and year so that you can setup the retention policy to suit. The Config.py file sets the retention schedule and can be modified easily.
